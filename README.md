# 2.DESCRIPTION
**Dataset:** The dataset used for this project consists of heart disease-related features. It is loaded from a CSV file named heart.csv.

**Input Features:** The model takes various medical and demographic features as input, provided as comma-separated values.

**Target Variable:** The target variable is a binary classification indicating whether the person has heart disease (1) or not (0).

**Best Model:** Logistic Regression

**Training Accuracy:**  84.88%
**Test Accuracy:** 80.49%

# 3.Input / Output
**Input:** The user provides comma-separated features (e.g., age, cholesterol level, etc.) through a web interface.

**Output:** The model predicts whether the person has heart disease or not, displayed on the web interface.
